Info: 

Public view: A dynamic, responsive website that displays articles, projects, and services to visitors. 
It includes a custom search functionality to easily find content.

Admin Dashboard: A secure, behind-login area for managing all website content. Key features include:

Content Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for articles and projects. The Task management will be soon improved. 

Secure Deletion: A robust, two-step confirmation process for deleting items, replacing standard browser popups with a more secure Laravel-based solution.

Dual Search: The application features two distinct search systems: a private search for administrators to find content within the dashboard and a separate, 
public-facing search for visitors.

Flash Messaging System: The application provides clear feedback to the administrator after actions like creating, updating, or deleting 
content by using session-based flash messages.
